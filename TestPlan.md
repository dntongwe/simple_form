This document describes the software test plan for the design, development, and testing of a single-user application to compare job offers with benefits, in different locations, and other aspects beyond salary.  

**Author**: \<Team189\>

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Several testing strategies will be utilized, including:

Unit Testing of each of main component and it will be conducted by a team member other than the developer of the component to ensure segregation of duties*

Integration Testing of all components, and it will be overseen by the project manager. Overall accountabiltiy of this test rest with the project manager, this person will utilize the team members to execute some test procedures* 

System Testing will be conducted, by the project manager

User Acceptance Testing, to be performed by other member of the team excluding the project manager* 



### 1.2 Test Selection

White-box technique will be utilized for test cases pertaining to Unit Testing and Integration Testing.

Black-box techniques will be utilized for test cases related to System Testing and User Acceptance Testing.


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion


Functional coverage will be assessed for System and User Acceptance testing while structural coverage will be assessed during unit and integration testing.

It is expected that prior to production deployment, the application will be bug-free and meet functional requirements specifications.


### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Defects identified during testing  will be logged and tracked in Defects Tracking for remediation. the tracking sheetin will be maintained in the team's repository in github. 


### 1.5 Technology

JUnit, a java-based unit testing framework, will be utilized for unit and integration testing

Android Emulators will be utilized for system and user acceptance testing. 


## 2 Test Cases

* TBD as Test cases are dependent on Use Cases.*
